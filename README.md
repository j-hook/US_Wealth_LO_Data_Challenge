# LO Data Challenge: Exploring US Wealth
## About this Project
This collaborative project was created in Jupyter Notebooks and R. We used Jupyter Notebooks to process the data and develop the visualizations. Then, we used python within R Markdown to design and render this page as HTML. You can find the source code for this project in on our Github. Data for this project comes from the US Census Bureau, curated by the [Lonely Octopus](https://www.lonelyoctopus.com/) team as part of a data challenge.

## Background
* **Wealth** and **Income** are two distinct measures of an individual's financial situation.  
    * **Income** = amount of money an individual earns (e.g. from employment, investments, or other sources)
    * **Wealth** = total value of an individual's assets (including cash, investments, real estate, and other possessions, minus liabilities such as debt)
* In general, **Income** and **Wealth** percentiles are not directly comparable because a high **Income** does not necessarily translate to a high level of **Wealth**. 
* Analyzing data on disparities of household **Wealth** has important implications for businesses and society, including:
  * Informing business strategies 
  * Understandiing the financial situation of potential customers
  * Helping policymakers and advocates address **Wealth** inequality 
  * Promoting economic opportunities for all. 
 
## Our Project
We have created a series of visualizations exploring the distribution of US wealth across wealth percentile groups, income percentile groups, education levels, and generation. These visuals were created with quarterly data from the third quarter of 1989 to the third quarter of 2022 gathered by the US Census Bureau.

In each of the visualizations we explored key characteristics contributing to wealth in the US over the last 33 years. All together, it’s clear the college-educated and those in the Baby Boomer generation consistently held a significant proportion of the wealth in this country. We also observed large disparities in wealth when it comes to examining both income and wealth percentiles, with those in the 50th percentile and below holding less 15% of nation’s wealth across both metrics.
